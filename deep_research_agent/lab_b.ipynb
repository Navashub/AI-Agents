       "- **LangChain**: A modular Python framework enabling the creation of LLM-powered agents with features like prompt chaining, memory integration, and external tool utilization. It supports various LLMs, including OpenAI and Cohere, and offers a rich ecosystem of tools for tasks such as web search and code execution. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen facilitates the development of multi-agent systems through natural language communication between agents. It includes built-in agents like AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent, and integrates with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI endpoints. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CrewAI**: This framework focuses on orchestrating role-based AI agents for collaborative tasks, emphasizing simplicity and minimal setup. It has gained significant popularity, with over 32,000 GitHub stars and nearly 1 million monthly downloads, particularly in customer service and marketing automation. ([datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/best-ai-agents?utm_source=openai))\n",

       "\n",
       "- **LangGraph**: An extension of LangChain, LangGraph allows developers to define agents as state machines, providing fine-grained control over agent state and facilitating complex workflows. It integrates with LangChainâ€™s tools, memory, and models, supporting loops, conditional branching, and persistent state.
